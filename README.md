## Applied technologies

The video game is developed using the C++ programming language, systems and tools provided by the Unreal Engine 5 game engine, such as Blueprints. For effective teamwork and project version control, the Git version control system and the GitHub web service are used, designed to host IT projects and facilitate the process of their joint development. 

## Gameplay

In MirWorld, players are tasked with managing a colony of survivors stranded on a distant planet. The gameplay is real-time, meaning events unfold continuously and players must manage their colony's resources, structures, and characters in real-time.

### Resource Management

Players must gather resources such as wood, stone, food, iron, and gold. These resources are used to build structures, research upgrades, and trade. Resources can be gathered by assigning tasks to the characters. The rate of resource gathering can be influenced by character skills and building upgrades.

### Building and Upgrades

Players can construct various buildings, each with its own functionality. For example, a lumber mill increases wood production, while a farm increases food production. Buildings can be upgraded to increase their efficiency.

### Character Management

Each character in the player's colony has unique skills and attributes. Players must assign tasks to characters based on their skills to maximize efficiency. Characters can gain experience and level up, improving their skills over time.

### Experience system

In Mir World, characters can accumulate experience by performing various actions, such as mining resources. Each resource has its own experience scale, and the time spent by a character on mining a particular resource accrues experience units for that resource.

When a character reaches a certain number of experience points for a resource, the extraction rate of that resource increases. This allows players to strategically distribute tasks between characters, taking into account their skills and experience, in order to maximize the efficiency of resource extraction.

### Victory Conditions

The game is won when the player achieves a certain score, which can be obtained by building structures, gathering resources, defeating enemies, and achieving various other game objectives. However, the game is lost if the player's score becomes non-positive.

Remember, the gameplay of MirWorld is dynamic and complex, offering players a rich and immersive gaming experience.
